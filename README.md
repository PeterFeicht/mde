University exercises in Model-driven Engineering

## Branches
There are two active branches:

 * `master` is used to develop the UI-agnostic part of the exercises, for example the Ecore model and OCL constraints.
 * `gmf` contains the GMF diagram editor.

# Exercise 1
In exercise 1 I developed a domain model for representing coding contests, and some OCL constraints to go with that.
A diagram editor for creating coding contest models is maintained on branch `gmf`.

Tag `ue1` is what I handed in.

# Exercise 2
In exercise 2 I developed model-to-model and model-to-text transformations for the coding contest model.

Tag `ue2` is what I handed in.

# Exercise 3
In exercise 3 I developed a model validation script for the betting manager model.

Tag `ue3` is what I handed in.

# Exercise 4
In this exercise I will evolve the coding contest model.
